# Loan-Approval-Prediction
In this Project we have to predict wheather the loan will be approved or not.
This is a classification problem where we have to predict whether a loan will be approved or not. Specifically, it is a binary classification problem where we have to predict either one of the two classes given i.e. approved (Y) or not approved (N). Another way to frame the problem is to predict whether the loan will likely to default or not, if it is likely to default, then the loan would not be approved, and vice versa. The dependent variable or target variable is the Loan_Status, while the rest are independent variable or features. We need to develop a model using the features to predict the target variable.
